# COVID and Bacterial Pneumonia Detector

In this repo, we train a deep learning model to distinguish between x-ray images of healthy individuals and those with COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia. To read our blog regarding this project, please visit [https://covidpneumoniaclassifier.wordpress.com/](https://covidpneumoniaclassifier.wordpress.com/). 

# Test it out

To test out this model for yourself, please visit our small user-friendly Github repo at [https://github.com/vivianngo97/COVID-Bacterial-Pneumonia-Classifier-Run-Model](https://github.com/vivianngo97/COVID-Bacterial-Pneumonia-Classifier-Run-Model). There will be instructions on how to run the model and classify your own x-ray images.
